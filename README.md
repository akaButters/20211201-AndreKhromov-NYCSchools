# Coding Challenge using NYC JSON data

This was my submission to JPMorgan's code challenge prior to an interview. 

It represents my solution to asyncronously fetching JSON data from an endpoint. It uses separation of concerns, a MVVM approach, unit tests, and a Mock webservice.

You are welcome to use it or learn from it in any way that you like.
